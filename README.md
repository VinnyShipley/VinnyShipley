<h3 align="center">The Story at the Beginning of the Story</h3>

<p>
Like many in the restaurant industry, the COVID-19 pandemic hit hard. The joy and stability I once found in that career disappeared, and I found myself adrift and uncertain about the future.
</p>

<p>
That changed when someone suggested I explore coding.
</p>

<p>
After some research and reflection, I enrolled in Code Fellows’ premier tech academy in 2022. Over the course of 9 months, I completed their rigorous program and earned a certificate in Advanced Software Development with Python.
</p>

<p>
Since graduating, I’ve continued to build my skills through hands-on projects and consistent learning — always looking for new ways to grow and apply what I’ve learned. The journey isn’t over, but I’m excited about the path I’m on.

<h2>🔍 Current Focus</h2>

<p>
I'm currently exploring the intersection of data analysis, machine learning, and customer experience — building out my technical portfolio while applying what I learn on real-world datasets.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using Python and SQL to clean and analyze messy, real-world data</li>
  <li>Visualizing insights in Tableau or Streamlit</li>
  <li>Evaluating and improving AI and NLP systems in customer support workflows</li>
</ul>

<h2>🛠️ What I'm Building</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Tweet Intent Classification</strong><br>
    A full-stack mini-project that classifies customer support tweets by intent (e.g. billing, complaint, praise). It uses TF-IDF, logistic regression, and additional engineered features — and exports predictions to Tableau for dashboard visualization.
  </li>
</ul>
