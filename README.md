<h3>The Story at the Beginning of the Story</h3>

Like so many other people employed in the restaurant industry, COVID was a wildly hard experience. The joy and stability that the industry provided before the pandemic was sucked from my first career and I was awash in a sea of ennui. That all changed when someone suggested that I pursue a career in coding.

After some shopping around, I finally decided to attend Code Fellows Premeier Tech Academy in 2022. After 9 months in the program, I was able to graduate with a certificate in Advanced Aoftware Development with Python. 

Since then I have worked to stay sharp in my coding skills and continue my job search. The journey continues!
